Palette Mapper

This app picks all of the colors out of an image, displays them in a palette, and
lets you click on colors in that palette to map them to some other color that you
choose.  It is intended for creating color-switched versions of spritesheets or
tilemaps.

This app was entirely vibe-coded using ChatGPT-5.
